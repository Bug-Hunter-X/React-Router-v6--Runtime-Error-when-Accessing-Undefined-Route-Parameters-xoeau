In React Router Dom v6, navigating to a route with a parameter that isn't defined in the `useParams` hook will cause a runtime error.  This is different from previous versions, which might have rendered a blank screen or silently failed.  The error message is typically something like `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'paramName')` where `paramName` is the parameter you're trying to access.  For example, if you have a route `/users/:userId` and try to access `userId` without checking if it's defined in the component, this will cause an error.
